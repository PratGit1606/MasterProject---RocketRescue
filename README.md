# 🚀 Features
1. Rocket Shooter 🚀
Rocket Shooter is a fun and engaging game where players control a rocket to shoot down asteroids. This game is designed to help stroke patients improve their hand-eye coordination and fine motor skills. By targeting and shooting at moving objects, players can practice and enhance their precision and reaction time.

2. Light Bulb Fixer 💡
Light Bulb Fixer is a drag-and-drop game that requires players to fix light bulbs by dragging them to their correct positions. This game aims to improve the patients' upper limb strength and dexterity. The drag-and-drop mechanics encourage repetitive arm movements, which are crucial for rebuilding muscle memory and enhancing motor skills.

3. Catch the Alien 👽
Catch the Alien is a sliding puzzle game where players need to slide tiles to form a complete picture of an alien. This game helps stroke patients by promoting cognitive functions such as problem-solving and spatial awareness. The sliding motion also aids in improving fine motor skills and hand coordination.
